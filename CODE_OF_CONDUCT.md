# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct (v2.1).

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our
community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity
and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our
community include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best for the community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
If you experience or witness unacceptable behavior:
- Open a discussion in the `General` category and tag `@alpha912`, or
- Open an issue with the prefix `[CODE OF CONDUCT]` and request maintainer attention.

For sensitive reports, start with a brief note requesting a private channel; a
maintainer will follow up without requiring sensitive details in public.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines in determining the consequences
for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. Correction
2. Warning
3. Temporary Ban
4. Permanent Ban

(See Contributor Covenant v2.1 for detailed definitions of each step.)

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org),
version 2.1.
