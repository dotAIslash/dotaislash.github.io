# DotAISlash Visual Assets

This page will house official logos, badges, and other visual collateral for DotAISlash and the VERSA ecosystem.

## Planned contents

- Wordmarks and icons (SVG and PNG)
- "VERSA 1.0 compliant" and "Powered by VERSA" badges
- Color tokens and typography references, derived from the CodeVibe design system
- Usage guidelines, licensing notes, and downloadable bundles

> Visual updates will be published here instead of a dedicated repository.
